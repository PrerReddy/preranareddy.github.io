      Currently, I work as Research Associate advised by Dr. Sharika K M at Social & Affective Cognition lab, Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Kanpur. My work focuses on decision-making under uncertainty & valance based reinforcement learning. I integrate, behavioral experiments, electroencephalogram, eye-tracking and computational modeling to study how people infer, understand, and learn though feedback under uncertain conditions to meet with the best possible outcome. </p>

     <p> I completed my master's dissertation supervised by Dr. Arun Sasidharan and Dr. Ramajayam G at the dept. of Neurophysiology, National Institute of Mental Health & Neuroscince. I worked on investigating the neural correlated of Pranayama (yogic brreathing) I employed electroencephalogram, heart rate variability, Galvanic skin sensors and respiratory belt to understand the correlation between the multimodal results of Pranayama on brain and body. I further presented the results at a National Mind, Brain & Consciousness Conference, held at IIT Mandi. </p>
