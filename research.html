      Currently, I work as Research Associate advised by Dr. Sharika K M at Social & Affective Cognition lab, Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Kanpur. My work focuses on decision-making under uncertainty & valance based reinforcement learning. I integrate behavioral experiments, electroencephalogram (EEG), eye-tracking and computational modeling to study how people infer, understand, and learn though feedback under uncertain conditions to meet with the best possible outcome. </p>

     <p> I completed my master’s dissertation under the supervision of Dr. Arun Sasidharan and Dr. Ramajayam G at the Department of Neurophysiology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS). My research investigated the neural correlates of Pranayama (yogic breathing). In this study, I employed electroencephalography (EEG), heart rate variability (HRV), galvanic skin response (GSR), and respiratory belt measurements to examine the multimodal effects of Pranayama on both brain and body. I presented these findings at the National Mind, Brain & Consciousness Conference held at IIT Mandi. </p>
