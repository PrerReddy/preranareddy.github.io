    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>
      I am a cognitive neuroscience researcher interested in social cognition,
      neural dynamics, and computational approaches to mind and behavior.
      Currently, I work as Research Associate advised by Dr. Sharika K M at Social & Affective Cognition lab, Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Kanpur. 
      My work focuses on decision-making under uncertainty & valance based reinforcement learning. I integrate, behavioral experiments, electroencephalogram, eye-tracking and computational modeling to study how 
      people infer, understand, and learn though feedback under uncertain conditions to meet with the best possible outcome.

      I completed my master's dissertation supervised by Dr. Arun Sasidharan and Dr. Ramajayam G at the dept. of Neurophysiology, National Institute of Mental Health & Neuroscince. I worked on investigating the neural correlated of Pranayama (yogic brreathing)
      I employed electroencephalogram, heart rate variability, Galvanic skin sensors and respiratory belt to understand the correlation between the multimodal results of Pranayama on brain and body. I further presented the results at a National Mind, Brain & Consciousness Conference, held at IIT Mandi.


      Outside of reseach, I like walking, painting, reading medical & philosophical journals, creating and consuming art, getting coffe with friends, napping. I am comitted to making knowledge acessible to everyone. Outside of practicing this with science, I also voluneeter to teach graded courses to underprivilaged kids from nearby rural areas.
